Mini Project: Descriptive Analytics Using File Handling
Project Overview
This project uses descriptive analytics to analyze the MovieLens dataset with Python file handling. By exploring movie ratings, genres, and user demographics, the goal is to derive insights into user preferences, movie popularity, and the relationships between these attributes.

1. Descriptive Analysis
We categorize movie ratings into high, medium, and low ratings to understand sentiment. We also identify the top 10 most-rated movies to uncover user preferences.

2. Genre Insights
This analysis identifies the most frequently rated genres and compares average ratings across genres to determine which ones tend to get higher ratings.

3. User Engagement Analysis
We identify the most active users based on the number of ratings given and explore how age, gender, and occupation influence user rating patterns.

4. Rating Distribution by Demographics
We investigate how ratings vary by user demographics and whether certain genres are more popular with specific age groups or occupations.

5. Top Performers
We highlight the movies with the highest average ratings, considering only those with a minimum number of ratings to ensure fairness. We also analyze their characteristics.

6. Exploring the Long Tail
We examine movies with very few ratings, exploring the "long tail" of the dataset, and comparing these movies to more popular ones to uncover common traits.

7. Tag Analysis
This section explores the most frequently used movie tags, checking if they align with movie genres to identify common themes and enhance recommendations.

8. Visualization Projects
We create dashboards and visualizations, including rating distributions by genres and years, popular genres by demographics, and heatmaps showing correlations between genres, user activity, and ratings.
